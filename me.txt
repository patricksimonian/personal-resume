about me:

    Much of what defines me is my passion for the outdoors; playing in Nature's
    playground. As well as playing music, videogames, woodworking, as well as
    spending time with my family
    and my girlfriend. I started my working career exploring several different
    paths from Aircraft Maintainence to Truck Driving. I'm happy I did all of that
    before finding my self where I am today. Because of it, I have a very broad
    skillset and
    the ability to view problems from different angles based on those past
    occupations. Ever since being introduced to the amazing world of coding
    I haven't looked back. It's challenging, fun, ever-changing and the community
    here in Victoria (at least) is amazing.
