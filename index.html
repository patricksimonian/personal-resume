      <h2>About</h2>
      <h3>A tinkerer at heart who loves to be out in the wild.</h3>
      <!--  -->
      <div>
        <h5>Me</h5>
        <p>Much of what defines me is my passion for the outdoors;
          playing music; videogames; cooking; tinkering with circuitry; woodworking;
          as well as spending as much time as I can with my family and my girlfriend ðŸ˜Š</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>It wasn't a straight line getting here</h5>
        <p>I started my working career early exploring several different
        paths from Aircraft Maintainence to Truck Driving.
        I'm happy I had the opportunity to seek out these different opportunities
        as it has shaped much of who I am today. I have a very <em>broad
        skillset, numerous certifications, and a multifaceted way</em>of approaching
        problems based from my experiences in my previous occupations.
        Ever since being introduced to the amazing world of coding I haven't
        looked back. It's challenging, fun, ever-changing and the community
        here in Victoria (especially Lighthouse) is amazing.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h5>Engaging With the Community</h5>
        <p>One of my favourite things about coding is that you can come from any
          background, from any age, with any disposition and be able to not only
          learn how to code but potentially succeed as a working developer.
          This is through my experience in the field but also from being apart
          of voluntary coding work shops, the Lighthouse Bootcamp as a Mentor
          and as an Instructor for the Lighthouse Fundamentals/Introductory Courses.
          Engaging with people and sharing their passion is something I enjoy and
          plan on continuing for the remainder of my career.
